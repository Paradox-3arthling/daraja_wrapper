# daraja_wrapper
## What it does
This is a wrapper library to the daraja API endpoints from safaricom Mpesa/Lipa na Mpesa

> This is a project is still in dev, though working parts
> should be ok.

## Why is it useful
- Making it easier to access the daraja API endpoints without actually having to know much about them.
- Hopefully the project can be used to learn more about the endpoints and the 'net/http' package from golang.
- Hopes to create a package that is able scale and while still being very fast.

## WIP
- Check issues for next feature updates to be done.
